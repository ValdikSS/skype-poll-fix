Skype poll fix
==============
This library is made to reduce Skype CPU consumption by increasing poll (on Linux) or kevent (on Mac OS) call timeouts. It lowers Skype idle CPU load from 4.4% down to 0.9% and improves battery life on my laptop, while making Skype only a bit slower.

How to use
----------
* Compile the source code with ```make```
* Run Skype with ```LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/skype-poll-fix.so skype``` on Linux or with ```DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/path/to/skype-poll-fix.dylib skype``` on Mac OS
* On Linux you can edit ```/usr/share/applications/skype.desktop``` file  to run Skype with ```skype-poll-fix.so``` automatically (example for Debian Jessie):
  * Change ```Exec=``` string to ```Exec=bash -c "LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/skype-poll-fix.so skype %U"```

Configuration
-------------
You can configure SET_POLL and MIN_POLL environmental variables. SET_POLL is a poll() or kevent() timeout value which would be set if Skype tries to poll with timeout less than MIN_POLL. Both variables are default to 300 ms.

#####Example
```LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/skype-poll-fix.so MIN_POLL=100 SET_POLL=250 skype```

All poll() timeouts less than 100 ms would be set to 250 ms.
